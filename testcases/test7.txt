Description: The intent is to see that the behavior of the simulation is as expected when elves infrequently encounter problems.

Constants:

public static final int ELF_PROBLEM_MILLIS_LOW = 3500;
public static final int ELF_PROBLEM_MILLIS_HIGH = 5000;
public static final double INIT_REINDEER_DELAY = INIT_DAYS_TO_XMAS * MILLIS_PER_DAY * .8;
public static final String[] REINDEER_NAMES =
    {"Dasher", "Dancer", "Prancer", "Vixen", "Comet", "Cupid", "Donner", "Blitzen", "Rudolph"};
